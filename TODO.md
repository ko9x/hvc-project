### Current Focus
* Create dataObj branch
    * Add logic to calulate any serial number that has a "T" in it as higher than a serial that does not have a "T"
    * Continue creating the dataObj to mimic a database for storing the dataObjects
        * Determine feasibility of using the current itemData object structure for all other items
        * Create a function that can use the current itemData object to spit out the correct High Voltage Cable 
            * Use the configs object to tell the function which config id to check the breakPoints for
                * Maybe pass the config id as an argument to the function

### Styling

    * Either way, we need compassion purple
